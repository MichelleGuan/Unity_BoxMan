# Unity_BoxMan1.0
- Simply open BoxMan scence and run it.
- You can click BoxMan to use setting. Press WASD or TopDownLeftRight Arrow to move as far as you pressed the key, and you can also move only one step by click the arrows on screen.
- End target turns yellow when your box arrives and YouWin panel will appear when all box arrives.
- All collision parts are writen by me, which is defitely not nessasery but a practice.
- Please move to BoxMan2.0 if you want a mature version which you can learn from as a beginer.
